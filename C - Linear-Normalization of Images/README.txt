In this assignment you will read in an image and normalize it. All
the instructions are in the file answer06.c.

As a programmer you must know how to compile and test your own code.
You are not supplied with a Makefile, and must develop your own 
system to build and test your program. I recommend using either
a Makefile, or writing a bash-script to do the job. A bash script
looks like this

#!/bin/bash

echo "Some command"
echo "do something else

They really are that simple. Writing a Makefile is also an important
skill, and you have sample Makefiles from previous assignments to
help you get started.

To help test your code, you are supplied with 5 images in a
custom image format called "ee264", and 9 corrupt test-cases. 
The "good" images are in the folder "images", and the corrupt
test-cases are in the folder "images/corrupt-testcases".

For your convenience, png versions of the "good" images are 
available in the "images/pngs" directory. You can view them in
most image viewer programs.

You should be able to successfully normalize the 5 "good" images,
and successfully "return NULL" for the 9 corrupt test-cases.
Open the corrupt test-cases in a hex editor and analyse them so
that you can see exactly what is wrong with them.

Please do not leave this assignment to the last minute.
